# Contributing to Camber
👍🎉 First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍 

The following is a set of guidelines and best practices for contributing to Camber. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What should I know before I get started?
### C# and .NET
Camber is written in [C#](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/csharp-programming-language/?ref=ghm), which is one of the primary languages used for developing Windows applications using [.NET](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-net-framework/?ref=lbp). While in theory it might work to contribute code in another .NET-enabled language such as VB.NET, there are several reasons not to do this:
* Dynamo Core is written in C#, and so all of the supporting documentation assumes the use of C#
* Mixing code written in different languages would create a management headache
* All non-C# code would have to go in a different project and compiled to a separate DLL from the rest of the code base

In summary, please only contribute code written in C#! 🙂
### Zero-Touch

### Visual Studio
### Project Structure
Although Camber appears in Dynamo as a single item in the library, it is actually a collection of multiple files that work together to function as a package.
