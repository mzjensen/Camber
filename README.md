# Camber

**Camber** is a package for Dynamo for Civil 3D that expands the capabilities of Dynamo within AutodeskÂ® Civil 3D. The main goals of the Camber project are to:

1. Expose more Civil 3D functionality beyond what is provided with the out-of-the-box nodes
2. Provide an open code base for those getting starting with Zero-Touch node development

## Features
Camber includes hundreds of nodes that utilize the AutoCAD and Civil 3D .NET APIs to provide read/write access to:

- Catchments
- Styles
- Labels
- Sample Lines
- Profile Views
- Section Views
- Pipe Networks
- Pressure Pipe Networks
- Parts Lists
- Design Checks
- Data Shortcuts
- Quantity Takeoff Criteria
- Block attribute definitions
- MLeaders
- Corridor surfaces
- Dimensions

The list is continually growing! See the [issues page](https://github.com/mzjensen/Camber/issues) to see what is being worked on.
