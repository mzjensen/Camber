## Camber
An open-source Dynamo package for Civil 3D.

Camber is a Dynamo for Civil 3D package that expands the capabilities of Dynamo within AutodeskÂ® Civil 3D. The main goals of the Camber project are to:

1. Expose more Civil 3D functionality beyond what is provided with the OOTB nodes
2. Provide an open code base for those getting starting with Zero-Touch node development
