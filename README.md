# Camber

**Camber** is a package for Dynamo for Civil 3D that expands the capabilities of Dynamo within AutodeskÂ® Civil 3D. The main goals of the Camber project are to:

1. Expose more Civil 3D functionality beyond what is provided with the out-of-the-box nodes
2. Provide an open code base for those getting starting with Zero-Touch node development

## A Word from the Author - October 2024
You may have noticed that there have not been any updates for quite some time (last release was 4.2.6 in March 2023). This is because I joined Autodesk in the summer of 2023, and so it no longer makes sense for me to maintain a side project when I am also working on Civil 3D directly. From this point forward, I do not have plans to make any more updates to Camber. Even though I am no longer actively maintaining the project, the doors are still open for contributions!

## Features
Camber includes hundreds of nodes that utilize the AutoCAD and Civil 3D .NET APIs to provide read/write access to:

- Catchments
- Styles
- Labels
- Sample Lines
- Profile Views
- Section Views
- Pipe Networks
- Pressure Pipe Networks
- Parts Lists
- Design Checks
- Data Shortcuts
- Quantity Takeoff Criteria
- Block attribute definitions
- MLeaders
- Corridor surfaces
- Dimensions
